Collection of primality certificates and an open source tool
that can be used to verify them (not yet finished).

Application can verify [Atkin-Goldwasser-Kilian-Morain Certificate](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Atkin-Goldwasser-Kilian-MorainCertificate.html),
[Pocklington certificate](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PocklingtonsTheorem.html)
and
[Brillhart, Lehmer, Selfridge certificate](http://www.ams.org/mcom/1975-29-130/S0025-5718-1975-0384673-1/S0025-5718-1975-0384673-1.pdf) (Theorem 15) based
primality proofs, commonly generated by the [Primo](http://www.ellipsa.eu/public/primo/primo.html)
application.

# Installation

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tomato42/ecpp-verifier.git
    cd ecpp-verifier

Install dependencies (for example on Fedora):

    dnf install python3-ecdsa python3-gmpy2

Or from PyPI:

    pip install ecdsa[gmpy2]


Run `ecpp` for the first time:

    ./ecpp --help

# Usage

## Verifying primes in OpenSSH moduli file

To verify you have primality ceritifacetes for all the primes in your OpenSSH
moduli file, you can use ecpp with `-m` switch:

    ./ecpp -m /etc/ssh/moduli

This will succeed for example for moduli file released with OpenSSH 8.2p1,
listing certificates for each prime.

## Generating primality certificates for primes in moduli file for OpenSSH

If there are some primes without primality certificates, you can generate
input files for Primo into `in/` directory.

    ./ecpp -m /etc/ssh/moduli -p

Now, open Primo downloaded from link above, extract archive and start GUI on
a reasonably powerful machine (at this moment, Primo can work with up to
64 cores).

 * From *Menu*, select *Configure*, set number of cores your system have
   (multithreading is not much useful)
 * In tab *Certification*, select *3000 dd* (decimal digits) in *Trial
   Division Parameters* and click *Build prime table* button.
 * THen click *Load*. Select all the `.in` files in
   the `in/` directory created by previous step and click *Open*.
 * After long time, you will get certificates in `*.out` files in the same
   directory.

## Verify primality certificates

In previous step, we got certificates for primes. Now we need to verify them.
This can be done with the following command for one certificate:

    ./ecpp -i in/primo-B412D0397A9D9-07E.out

The job can be simply parallelized so if we want to verify all
the certificates we got, we can use GNU parallel to get results in parallel,
in this example using 16 parallel processes:

    parallel -j16 "echo {} && ./ecpp -i {}" ::: in/*.out

Now, we can add the primality certificates to `certificates/` directory

## Verifying primes in OpenSSH moduli file again

Running `ecpp` again as in the first example should confirm we have
a certificate for each prime in the moduli file now.

    ./ecpp -m /etc/ssh/moduli
